Mathematical functions other than aggregate functions

Ceil and Floor functions

syntax- 
ceil(number)

floor(number)

select order_line, 
sales, 
ceil(sales), 
floor(sales) 
from sales 
where discount>0;

Random function helps in generating a random nuber 
in [0,1)

If we want a random number between [a,b)
select random()*(b-a)+a;


select random ()*50+0;(Number in range 0 to 50)


If we want a random integer in [a,b]

select floor(random()*(b-a+1))+a;

select floor(random()*40)+10;(Random integr between 10 and 50)







if we Setseed by calling function, the random function will return a repetable sequence of 
random nubers derived from seed

select setseed(0.5);
select random();

select random();

select setseed(0.5);

select random();

select random();

(This helps in getting the same set of random values) The first random in both 
cases will give the same values.




Round function

(Round function return a rounded off value to nearest integer)

select order_line,
sales, 
round(sales)
from sales 
order by sales 
desc;




Power function


Gives power value of m raised to power n in power(m,n)

select age, 
power(age,2) 
from customer 
order by age;
