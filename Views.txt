Views are not physical tables, but virtual tables created by a query joining two or more tables.
Advantage of views-

In the views,
Since being virtual tables, they dont use space from our data base and
while working with teams, views also help in showing a certain amount of data to others in the team,
whereby hiding the whole data


create view logistics 
as 
select
a.order_line,
a.order_id,
b.customer_name,
b.city,
b.state,
b.country
from sales as a
left join customer as b
on a.customer_id=b.customer_id
order by a.order_line;

select * from logistics;



We can also use Create or
Replace view

Advantage of this is that the views will be replaced with the new data



to delete view- Use : drop view logistics


to update view use:

update logistics set country= US where country="United States";


(Not advisable to update view as updating a view also updates the table)
