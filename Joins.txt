Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables at a time.
5 types mainly

Inner Join compares each row of table 1 with each row of table 2 to find rows which satisfy the join predicate.
It is basically an intersection of tables


select a.order_line, a.product_id,a.customer_id,a.sales,b.customer_name,b.age
from sales_2015 
as a 
inner join cutomer_20_60 as b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
order by customer_id;



left join 
Returns all rows from left table even if no match of it in other table
select a.order_line, a.product_id,a.customer_id,a.sales,b.customer_name,b.age
from sales_2015 
as a 
left join cutomer_20_60 as b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
order by customer_id;



right join 
Returns all rows from right table even if no match of it in other table
select a.order_line, a.product_id,b.customer_id,a.sales,b.customer_name,b.age
from sales_2015 
as a 
right join cutomer_20_60 as b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
order by customer_id;(Here customer id has been taken from table b as if from a, then customer with null sales will also come)



Outer Join/Full Join
Combines all the results


select a.order_line, a.product_id,a.customer_id,a.sales,b.customer_name,b.age,b.customer_id
from sales_2015 
as a 
full join cutomer_20_60 as b 
on a.customer_id = b.customer_id 
order by a.customer_id,b.customer_id;




Cross Join
Gives cartesian product between two data sets


Except command

Evaluates A-(A intersection B) removing parts of table 2 from 1

select customer_id 
from sales_2015 
except 
select customer_id 
from cutomer_20_60 
order by customer_id;


Union Operator
Union operator combines rsult set of two or more tables
Also removes duplicate rows



select customer_id 
from sales_2015 
union  
select customer_id 
from cutomer_20_60 
order by customer_id;
